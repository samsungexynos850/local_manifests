# local_manifests

	git clone https://github.com/samsungexynos850/local_manifests -b lineage-20 .repo/local_manifests

# Note

- When syncing, use the command repo sync --force-sync so the trees can be overwritten, you may have to run this a few times for it to work.
- This manifest only works for lineage, since Lineage inherited code is edited.
- For other custom ROM's either create a manifest yourself or email me, as I might develop one.
